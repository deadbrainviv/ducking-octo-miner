==================

A multi hardware multi currency mining software with a client and a cloud based tracking

This is a python based desktop app (for windows mac and linux) with necessary code segments to connect to a mining hardware 
(ASIC / FPGA) - external
(GPU / CPU) - Internal

The software will also enable a web based admin panel with centralized logging , near real-time tracking of mining hardware, manage a group/cluster of mining hardware and further enable mutiple currecy mining allocation per hardware/ across hardware.
